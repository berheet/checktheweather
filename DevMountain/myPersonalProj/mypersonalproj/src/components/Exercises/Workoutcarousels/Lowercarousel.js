                elbows until your upper arms are parallel to the floor. Take the
                bar out of the rack and let it rest on your fingertips. Your
                elbows should be all the way up throughout the movement. Step
                back and set your feet at shoulder width with toes turned out
                slightly. Squat as low as you can without losing the arch in
                your lower back.{" "}

                Get onto all fours and prop yourself up on your forearms. "Turn
                your palms up toward the sky, keeping your thumbs on the ground,
                and form a straight line from your head to your heels," Dunham
                says. Squeeze your glutes and quads, which will draw your knees
                up and prevent sagging. "Brace your core as if you were
                expecting a kick to the stomach, and press your forearms into
                the ground," he adds. Once you feel everything tighten, squeeze
                even harder and take big, deliberate breaths as you plank. To
                increase the challenge, squeeze harder and exhale more air with
                each breath as you hold the position.{" "}

                Get down on all fours with your hands under your shoulders and
                knees under hips. Pick your knees up an inch or two off the
                ground—you're not sticking your butt in the air, so stay low.
                Keep your chest pushed away from the floor, as if to avoid
                something sharp from poking you in the sternum. Raise your head
                so you're just looking in front of you, and start to move
                forward, using opposite arms and legs. "Try to float with each
                step, and breathe comfortably," Dunham says. Ramp up the
                intensity by moving in multiple directions, and increasing your
                speed.

                Hold a pushup position with your feet on sliding discs. "Squeeze
                your glutes hard to lock in your hips and lower back," Dunham
                says. "Create tension through your legs by pulling your belly
                button up toward your chin, and your knees up to your chest," he
                adds. Slowly pull one knee toward your chest, without letting
                your torso or hips drop, then slowly extend that leg back to a
                pushup position. Repeat on the other leg. Each rep should be a
                3:3 tempo—three seconds in, three seconds out. "Sync your breath
                with the movement: A slow exhale as you pull the knee in, then
                an inhale to reset in the pushup position," he says.
